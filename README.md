Data Pre-processing
Data preprocessing is an important step in the data life-cycle process. It is performed on raw data before it gets prepared for data mining/data analytics/machine learning process. Considering the fact that high quality data leads to better modeling and analysis (“Garbage in, garbage out”), data preprocessing has become vital and the crucial fundamental step in the data life-cycle process.
I have discussed key steps and processes for data preprocessing in the attached Notebook with code examples.
